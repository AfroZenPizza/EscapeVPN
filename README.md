## Who is it for

Intended for use by anyone that is using Windows and has a captive VPN that they

it. Running this may result in a negative interaction with your employer - Use
at your own risk

for a buesiness network. Update the $route variables as needed for your VPN

## Where may I?

Don't know. Anywhere really. Work, home, vacation resort. Just be wise about it.
If you're disabling this it will may allow other devices to interact with yours.

## When could I?

When running any captive VPN, after the connection has been established of
course.

## Why would I?

Because you can. Because you want to be able to watch Youtube or play games
while connected to your work computer to multi-task. Couldn't say for sure.
There may be moral or ehtical issues with this.
